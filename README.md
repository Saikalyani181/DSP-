INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
_________________________

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
There are four main Python coding styles: imperative, functional, object-oriented, and procedural. (Some people combine imperative and functional coding styles while others view them as completely separate styles.


TYPES
______

What are the 5 types of data in Python?
Python has five standard Data Types:
Numbers.
String.
List.
Tuple.
Dictionary.

   
**   NUMBERIC Type
   ---------------
In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

Integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
Float – This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.
Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example – 2+3j



Sequence Type
-------------
In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python –

String
List
Tuple

1) String
---------
In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.
Creating String :
Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.

example:
 Creating a String  
# with single Quotes 
String1 = 'Welcome to the Geeks World'
print("String with the use of Single Quotes: ") 
print(String1) 

output:
Welcome to the Geeks World

2) List
---------  
Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is a ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
Creating List
Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].

example:
List = [] 
print("Initial blank List: ") 
print(List) 

output:
Initial blank List: 
[]

3) Tuple
---------
Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by tuple class.
Creating Tuple
In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, list, etc.).

example:
# Creating an empty tuple 
Tuple1 = () 
print("Initial empty Tuple: ") 
print (Tuple1) 

output:
Initial empty Tuple: 
()

Dictionary
----------
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.

Creating Dictionary:
-------------------
In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. Dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing it to curly braces{}.
example:
# Creating an empty Dictionary 
Dict = {} 
print("Empty Dictionary: ") 
print(Dict) 

output:
Empty Dictionary: 
{}
